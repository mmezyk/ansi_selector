## Automatic data selection algorithm for ambient noise seismic interferometry

This repository contains IPython Notebook with sample code and arbitrary ambient noise panels, complementing research artictle about automatic seismic event detection using Convolutional Neural Networks for long passive seismic recordings acquaired with large N-arrays.

You can view **"training.ipynb"** and **"prediction.ipynb"** directly on GitHub, or clone the repository, install dependencies listed in the notebook and play with code locally.
